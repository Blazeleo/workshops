# workshops
Welcome to the workshops library! Anyone can contribute a workshop. All you have to do is submit a pull request that creates a new directory in this folder with the name of your workshop (ex. personal_website) and includes a file called README.md in the created directory with the content of your workshop (ex. personal_website/README.md)

README.md must be written in the Markdown syntax. We recommend [this cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/) for getting started with Markdown.

If you have any questions, please [join us on the Discord](https://discord.gg/gpkg9zW)  and we'll be more than happy to give you a hand ðŸ˜„.
